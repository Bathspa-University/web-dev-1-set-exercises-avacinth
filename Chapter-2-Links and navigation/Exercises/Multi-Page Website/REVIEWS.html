            The 100 is a good show to watch though it would not work out for those who are peculiar about how accurate are the science 
            facts ( esp things like radiation etc). A job well done on certain cast members like Bellamy, Octavia and of course Murphy 
            who survived it all. Also kudos to Raven however was disappointed by the death of good characters like Finn and Lincoln. A 
            great show for survival and team work strategies however Clarke was sometimes boring in the essence of 'killing a few in 
            order to save many' aspect and wherever she is or makes a  decision, a lot of people die.... I love her and I'm also glad 
            that she is actually married to Bellamy in real life. The plots were unpredictable as they took a twist of turns and that's 
            a good thing as you do not know what to expect. Can't wait for SS7#wonkru. It greatly emphasize on friendship and family and 
            saving your own people... However in this show some friends became enemies and some enemies became friends.

            The 100 is PERFECTION. This show is very very binge-worthy. Iâ€™m a science fiction geek and by far the 100 has covered every 
            base I can think of. I love the characters, their development is awesome and you really get in touch with them. Thereâ€™s 
            always an extreme, impossible goal something you are hoping for this group of ragtag space kids to accomplish despite the 
            crazy circumstances and the astronomical odds.  Whether itâ€™s, Earth or space or Sanctum, thereâ€™s a fight and you can be 
            sure that the 100 will triumph no matter the cost. Special credits to Eliza Taylor as the one and only fearless Clarke 
            Griffin and to Bob Morley for his caring yet strong portrayal of Bellamy Blake. And of course, Blood Reina deserves a 
            credit, Octavia Blake is driving for an extremely difficult part to play.<br><br>
      
            I have never rated a show before but I feel this one deserves it. Perfect series to watch. Definitely recommended.
