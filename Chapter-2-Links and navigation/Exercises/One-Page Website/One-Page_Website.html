    <h2> Plot Overview </h2><br>
    <div class="plot-text">
      <p style="border-bottom: 2px solid #ccc; padding-bottom: 30px;">
        Ninety-seven years after a devastating nuclear apocalypse wipes out most human life on Earth, 
        thousands of people now live in a space station orbiting Earth, which they call the Ark. Three generations have 
        been born in space, but when life-support systems on the Ark begin to fail, one hundred juvenile detainees are sent 
        to Earth in a last attempt to determine whether it is habitable, or at least save resources for the remaining residents 
        of the Ark. They discover that some humans survived the apocalypse: the Grounders, who live in clans locked in a power 
        struggle; the Reapers, another group of grounders who have been turned into cannibals by the Mountain Men; and the Mountain 
        Men, who live in Mount Weather, descended from those who locked themselves away before the apocalypse. Under the leadership 
        of Clarke and Bellamy, the juveniles attempt to survive the harsh surface conditions, battle hostile grounders and establish 
        communication with the Ark.
      </p><br>
      <p style="border-bottom: 2px solid #ccc; padding-bottom: 30px;">
        In the second season, forty-eight of the remaining detainees are captured and taken 
        to Mount Weather by the Mountain Men. These are transfusing blood from imprisoned grounders as an anti-radiation treatment as 
        their bodies have not adapted to deal with the remaining radiation on Earth. Medical tests of the forty-eight show their bone
        marrow will allow the Mountain Men to survive outside containment, so they begin taking the youths' bone marrow. Meanwhile, 
        the inhabitants of the Ark have crash-landed various stations on Earth and begin an alliance with the grounders to save both 
        their people, naming the main settlement at Alpha Station "Camp Jaha". The season ends with the massacre of the Mountain Men 
        to save the prisoners. During this time, former Chancellor Jaha leads a group in search of a fabled "City of Light". Jaha 
        discovers an artificial intelligence named A.L.I.E. while John Murphy finds an alarming video implying a connection between 
        the AI and the destruction of the world.
      </p><br>
      <p style="border-bottom: 2px solid #ccc; padding-bottom: 30px;">
          In the third season, Alpha Station, renamed Arkadia, comes under new management when Pike, a former teacher and mentor on the 
          Ark, is elected as chancellor and begins a war with the grounders. Pike kills an encampment of grounder warriors while they sleep, 
          which further damages their already fragile relationship with the grounders. Furthermore, the grounder commander Lexa is killed by 
          her mentor during a failed assassination attempt on Clarke, with whom she was romantically involved. A.L.I.E. – who was commanded to 
          make life better for mankind – is revealed to have responded to the problem of human overpopulation by launching the nuclear apocalypse 
          that devastated Earth, and begins to use ingestible computer chips to take control of peoples' minds. A.L.I.E. is ultimately destroyed 
          by Clarke, but not before warning of another impending apocalyptic disaster.
      </p><br>
      <p style="border-bottom: 2px solid #ccc; padding-bottom: 30px;">
          In the fourth season, two dozen nuclear reactors around the world are melting down due to decades of neglect that will result in the 
          majority of the planet becoming uninhabitable. Clarke and the others search for ways to survive the coming wave of radiation. When it 
          is discovered that the grounders with black blood – known as the Nightbloods – can metabolize radiation, Clarke and the others attempt 
          to recreate the formula, but fail to test it. An old bunker is discovered that can protect 1,200 people for over five years from the new 
          apocalypse; each of the twelve clans selects a hundred people to stay in the bunker. A small group decides to return to space and attempt 
          to survive in the remnants of the Ark. Clarke, who is now a nightblood, remains on the Earth's surface alone.
      </p><br>
      <p style="border-bottom: 2px solid #ccc; padding-bottom: 30px;">
          In the fifth season, six years after the meltdown of the nuclear reactors, a prisoner transport ship arrives in the only green spot left 
          on Earth, where Clarke has been living with Madi, a young Nightblood grounder who also survived the wave of radiation that swept the planet 
          after the meltdown. Those who survived in space and in the bunker have returned safely on the ground. A struggle for the Shallow Valley 
          between the prisoners and a new, united clan, known as Wonkru, begins, resulting in a battle ending with the valley being destroyed. The 
          survivors escape to space and go into cryosleep while they wait for the Earth to recover. However, Monty believes that Earth will apparently 
          never recover and, before dying of old age, sets the prison ship on a course for a new world.
      </p><br>
      <p style="border-bottom: 2px solid #ccc; padding-bottom: 30px;">
          In the sixth season, after 125 years in cryosleep, Clarke, Bellamy, and the others wake up to find out that they are no longer orbiting Earth 
          and have been brought to a new habitable world, Alpha, also known as Sanctum. After landing on this world, they discover a new society, led by 
          ruling families known as the Primes. They also discover new dangers in this new world, and a mysterious rebel group, known as the Children of 
          Gabriel, as well as a mysterious Anomaly. Clarke falls victim to the Primes and ends up in a battle with one for control of her body, a fight 
          which she ultimately wins. The season ends with the deaths of most of the Primes, but also with the loss of Abby Griffin and Marcus Kane. 
          Throughout the season, Madi is haunted through the Flame AI by the spirit of the Dark Commander, an evil grounder leader that had ruled when 
          Indra was a child. In order to save Madi, Raven is forced to destroy the Flame, but the Dark Commander escapes.
      </p><br>
      <p>
          The seventh season finds the inhabitants of Sanctum trying to find a way to live together in peace following the aftermath of the events of 
          the previous season while battling the resurrected Dark Commander. At the same time, Clarke and others come into conflict with the mysterious 
          Disciples, humans from another world who are convinced that Clarke holds the key to winning the last war that is coming. The season also explores 
          the mysterious Anomaly introduced in the sixth season, now identified as a wormhole linking six planets, one of them being a regenerated Earth, 
          together. After vanishing and being believed dead for some time, Bellamy returns but converts to the Disciple cause, having gone through a 
          life-changing experience while stuck in the cold and treacherous mountains. After returning and converting to the Disciple cause, this leads 
          to his death at Clarke's hands. At the end of the series, the Dark Commander is permanently killed by Indra and humanity achieves Transcendence 
          aside from Clarke who committed murder during the test. They find out the test isn't an actual war, but a way to join the alien hive mind, 
          which is a peaceful universal consciousness that grants immortality. Clarke returns to Earth where her surviving friends and Octavia's new 
          boyfriend Levitt choose to join her to live out their lives, so that Clarke will not be alone. They will not have children, due to their 
          infertility and sterility, and the series ends with Clarke's group being the last humans to ever live on the mortal plane of existence, 
          on a pristine Earth, which is now habitable again.

      <p style="border-bottom: 2px solid #ccc; padding-bottom: 30px;">
      The 100 is a good show to watch though it would not work out for those who are peculiar about how accurate are the science 
      facts ( esp things like radiation etc). A job well done on certain cast members like Bellamy, Octavia and of course Murphy 
      who survived it all. Also kudos to Raven however was disappointed by the death of good characters like Finn and Lincoln. A 
      great show for survival and team work strategies however Clarke was sometimes boring in the essence of 'killing a few in 
      order to save many' aspect and wherever she is or makes a  decision, a lot of people die.... I love her and I'm also glad 
      that she is actually married to Bellamy in real life. The plots were unpredictable as they took a twist of turns and that's 
      a good thing as you do not know what to expect. Can't wait for SS7#wonkru. It greatly emphasize on friendship and family and 
      saving your own people... However in this show some friends became enemies and some enemies became friends.

      <p style="border-bottom: 2px solid #ccc; padding-bottom: 30px;">
      The 100 is PERFECTION. This show is very very binge-worthy. I’m a science fiction geek and by far the 100 has covered every 
      base I can think of. I love the characters, their development is awesome and you really get in touch with them. There’s 
      always an extreme, impossible goal something you are hoping for this group of ragtag space kids to accomplish despite the 
      crazy circumstances and the astronomical odds.  Whether it’s, Earth or space or Sanctum, there’s a fight and you can be 
      sure that the 100 will triumph no matter the cost. Special credits to Eliza Taylor as the one and only fearless Clarke 
      Griffin and to Bob Morley for his caring yet strong portrayal of Bellamy Blake. And of course, Blood Reina deserves a 
      credit, Octavia Blake is driving for an extremely difficult part to play.<br><br>

      I have never rated a show before but I feel this one deserves it. Perfect series to watch. Definitely recommended.
